    //MAYBE MAKE A WHILE LOOP FOR taking turns? and we can set the condition until someone wins or loses or ties

//1. figure out where each index is, and be able to assign an X or O to that index in the gameboard array
//2. print that X or O to in the gameboard array
//3. Set up invalid games, such as O and X can't both win
//4. need to set up options for winning, losing, and tying
//5. create a interface for it (GUI)

//steps for gameboard:
/* 1. player 1 does a move
    2. gameboard reflects said move
    3. updated gameboard is shown to player 2
    4. player to selects a move
    5. updated gameboard is shown to player 1
    6. repeat
